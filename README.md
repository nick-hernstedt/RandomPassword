For this project I used HTML, Javascript and some CSS,  I did not have the time i had hoped for to polish it up like I would have liked.
I have been struggling with Javascript and have been practicing by coding along hopeing that it will soon click for me.  I had to watch a a video to get everything to work with this project.  Hopefully soon I will be able to do things like this with only needing to google here and there.
